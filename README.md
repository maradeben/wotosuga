# WO'TOSUGA
### Personalized AI-Diabetes Assisstant

## Introduction:
Wotosuga is an AI powered diabetes solution with the intent of making diabetes care more easily accessible, bypassing the necessity of hospitals, labs and needle pricks to give a provisional asssessment of the diabetes risk status of a person.

It used a Machine Learning model in the backend to make the predictions and serves the results.

Features are thus:
- Diabetes risk status prediction
- Results with analytics and personalized recommendations
- Educative blog
- User profile
- Healthcare specialists page for further care.

Much of these are still under development at this time.
